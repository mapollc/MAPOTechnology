Another warm day today in the mid to upper 90s with abundant sunshine and relative humidity values dipping into the teens and mid 20 percent range.<\/p><p>Concerns over the next few days include breezy to locally windy conditions, namely out of the NW and through the Baker Valley region in addition to very low relative humidity values. As high pressure attempts to resume over the 4 Corners region, and a low pressure system stalls off the coast, the Durkee fire area will be in a region of persistent breeziness that favors an uptick in the Baker Valley winds each afternoon and evening in addition to above average temperatures<\/p>"
