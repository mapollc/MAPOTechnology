    <p>As of April 2024, the US Forest Service is seeking input on the Blue Mountains Forest Plan Revision (<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/home/?cid=fseprd1066821">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/home/?cid=fseprd1066821</a>). 
        This plan has a potentially drastic effect on travel and use of recreation roads and trails in the Wallowa Mountains, Elkhorn Mountains, Blue Mountains, and more in the 
        Wallowa Whitman, Umatilla, and Malheur national forests.</p>

    <p>The initial Forest Service release is a map identifying an "Inventory of Lands in the Plan Area that may have Wilderness Characteristics" 
        (<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1171915.pdf">https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1171915.pdf</a>). Input from the public has been requested.</p>

    <p>Our database of recreation opportunities at MAPO LLC is the most comprehensive accurate GPS-tracked trails and roads in the area. All trails are confirmed in person on the 
        ground with travel using GPS data collection.  We have developed a map that overlays these trails and roads over the identified "wilderness characteristics" areas to 
        demonstrate existing usage that is not characteristic of wilderness rules and restrictions.</p>
