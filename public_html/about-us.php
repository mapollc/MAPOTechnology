                <h2>Map of Fire: The Most Comprehensive Wildfire Map</h2>

                <p>Wildfire mapping is our primary public safety focus. Our only
                    goal mapping wildfire data is to have one, standardized place for everyone to get information on "what's on fire." Of course, we didn't stop there.
                    Over the last few years we've made <a href="https://mapofire.com?utm_campaign=mapotechnology.com&utm_medium=link&utm_source=about">Map of Fire</a> the
                    <u>most</u> comprehensive wildfire mapping tool available with over 30 data layers available.
                    Map of Fire is currently available on any device's browser with an Android-exclusive app coming Summer 2025.

                    mobile app, exclusively for Android, that we've released. Using data from the <a href="https://tripcheck.com" target="blank">Oregon Department of Transportation</a> we created a user-friendly app
                    that lets you follow road conditions, current weather, and roadside cameras. But, we took it another step and built in notifications that
                    advise of changing conditions for areas you're interested in. Currently, nothing similar exists for travelers in Oregon.

                    those hiking, mountain biking, etc. Map of Trails lets you see accurate, on-the-ground tracks, photos, and other important data like avalanche shading for
