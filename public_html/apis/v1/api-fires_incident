Those unable to attend can watch the meeting live on the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Facebook page @SequoiaKingsNPS or YouTube channel @sequoiaandkingscanyonnps5018.CURRENT SITUATION: Airtankers and helicopters applied water on the fire\u2019s northeastern edge and retardant to the control line along the Horse Creek drainage throughout the day yesterday. Fire around the confluence of Horse Creek and the East Fork Kaweah River burned at low to moderate intensity while staying within its current footprint. Hotshot crews conducted burnout operations and worked with air operations to construct and strengthen control lines around Homers Nose.&nbsp;Today, aerial operations will continue to support crews with tactical retardant drops as they construct direct handline on the north and south sides of Horse Creek and around Homers Nose. In addition, water drops will be used to cool the fire, slowing its spread, allowing firefighters safer opportunities to engage. Firefighters will continue to check for hotspots, strengthen lines, and backhaul equipment along the southern and western flanks of the fire.WEATHER:&nbsp;As the trough moves eastward, expect a cooler day with steady humidity and lighter afternoon winds, creating a calm and stable atmosphere. The trough\u2019s progression will bring slightly milder conditions, reducing the intensity of both heat and wind while maintaining clear skies. This stable weather pattern should hold throughout the day, offering no significant fluctuations in temperature or moisture levels.SMOKE IMPACTS:&nbsp;Air quality conditions greatly improved throughout the outlook area due to moderate fire activity. Today expect GOOD air quality conditions North and South of the fire, with MODERATE conditions closest to the fire in Hammond and Three Rivers this morning, but clearing to GOOD air quality throughout the forecast area this afternoon.

Fuels transition again to oak woodland with scattered scrub oak and grass understory at the lower elevations. 1000- hour fuels are available to burn with fuel moisture measured between 4%-10% depending on aspect and elevation.
